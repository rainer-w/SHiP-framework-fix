## Modification

This repository is based on the original [SHiP-framework](https://github.com/pasiweber/SHiP-framework) by Pascal Weber.

It contains a fix in the DCTree distance-matrix implementation: the distance matrix is explicitly initialized before being populated in parallel. This prevents uninitialized values from occurring in the resulting distance matrix.

All original SHiP functionality is otherwise preserved.

This repository is the official implementation of the Similarity-Hierarchical-Partitioning (SHiP) clustering framework proposed in [Ultrametric Cluster Hierarchies: I Want `em All!](https://github.com/pasiweber/SHiP-framework/) This framework provides a comprehensive approach to clustering by leveraging similarity trees, $(k,z)$-hierarchies, and various partitioning objective functions. 

The whole project is implemented in C++ and Python bindings enable the usage within Python.


## Overview
The SHiP framework operates in three main stages:
[![SHiP framework overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasiweber/SHiP-framework/main/docs/ClusterFrameworkOverview.png)](https://github.com/pasiweber/SHiP-framework/)

1. **Similarity Tree Construction:** A similarity tree is built for the given dataset. This tree represents the relationships and proximities between data points. Note that the default constructed tree corresponds to the $k$-center hierarchy (Section 3 in the paper).
2. **$(k,z)$-Hierarchy Construction:** Using the similarity tree, a $(k,z)$-hierarchy can be constructed. These hierarchies correlate to common center based clustering methods, as e.g., $k$-median or $k$-means (Section 4).
3. **Partitioning:** Finally, the data is partitioned based on the constructed hierarchy and a user-selected partitioning objective function (Section 5).


## Features
- **Similarity Trees:** The package provides a set of similarity/ultrametric tree implementations:
  - `DCTree` [[1]](#references)
  - `HST` [[2]](#references)
  - `CoverTree` [[3]](#references)
  - `KDTree` [[3]](#references)
  - `MeanSplitKDTree` [[3]](#references)
  - `BallTree` [[3]](#references)
  - `MeanSplitBallTree` [[3]](#references)
  - `RPTree` [[3]](#references)
  - `MaxRPTree` [[3]](#references)
  - `UBTree` [[3]](#references)
  - `RTree` [[3]](#references)
  - `RStarTree` [[3]](#references)
  - `XTree` [[3]](#references)
  - `HilbertRTree` [[3]](#references)
  - `RPlusTree` [[3]](#references)
  - `RPlusPlusTree` [[3]](#references)
  - Or use `LoadTree` to load a precomputed tree


- **$(k,z)$-Hierarchies:** It supports all possible $(k,z)$-hierarchies, allowing flexibility in choosing the most suitable hierarchy for a given dataset.
  - $z = 0$ &rarr; $k$-center (actually in theory: $z = ∞$, but in this implementation we use 0 for $∞$)
  - $z = 1$ &rarr; $k$-median
  - $z = 2$ &rarr; $k$-means
  - ...

- **Partitioning Functions:** A wide range of partitioning functions are available, enabling users to select the most appropriate function based on their specific needs:
  - `K`
  - `Elbow`
  - `Threshold`
  - `ThresholdElbow`
  - `QCoverage`
  - `QCoverageElbow`
  - `QStem`
  - `QStemElbow`
  - `LcaNoiseElbow`
  - `LcaNoiseElbowNoTriangle`
  - `MedianOfElbows`
  - `MeanOfElbows`
  - `Stability`
  - `NormalizedStability`

- **Customization:** Users can customize the framework by selecting from the available similarity trees, $(k,z)$-
hierarchies, and partitioning functions.
  - E.g., `DCTree` with $k$-means ($z=2$)-hierarchy and the `Elbow` partitioning method.
    ```python
    from SHiP import SHiP

    # Build the `DCTree`
    ship = SHiP(data=data_points, treeType="DCTree")
    # Extract the clustering from the $k$-median hierarchy and the `Elbow` partitioning method
    labels = ship.fit_predict(hierarchy=2, partitioningMethod="Elbow")
    ```

  - Or to get clustering with exact $k$ clusters:
    ```python
    from SHiP import SHiP

    ship = SHiP(data=data_points, treeType="DCTree")
    # Extract the clustering from the $k$-median hierarchy and get `k` clusters
    ship.k = k # Set k here
    labels = ship.fit_predict(hierarchy=2, partitioningMethod="K")
    ```


## Installation
### Stable Version
The current stable version can be installed by the following command:<br/>
`pip install SHiP-framework`

Note that a gcc compiler is required for installation.
Therefore, in case of an installation error, make sure that:
- Windows: [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/visual-cpp-build-tools/) is installed
- Linux/Mac: Python dev is installed (e.g., by running `apt-get install python-dev` - the exact command may differ depending on the linux distribution)

The error messages may look like this:
```
error: command 'gcc' failed: No such file or directory
Could not build wheels for SHiP-framework, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects
Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required. Get it with "Microsoft C++ Build Tools
```


### Development Version
The current development version can be installed directly from git by executing:<br/>
`sudo pip install git+https://github.com/pasiweber/SHiP-framework.git`

Alternatively, clone the repository, go to the root directory and execute:<br/>
`pip install .`


## Code Example
```python
from SHiP import SHiP

ship = SHiP(data=data, treeType="DCTree")

# or to load a saved tree
ship = SHiP(data=data, treeType="LoadTree", config={"json_tree_filepath": "<file_path>"}) 
# or additionally specify the tree_type of the loaded tree by adding {"tree_type": "DCTree"}

ship.hierarchy = 0
ship.partitioningMethod = "K"
labels = ship.fit_predict()

# or in one line
labels = ship.fit_predict(hierarchy = 1, partitioningMethod = "Elbow")

# optional: save the current computed tree
json = ship.get_tree().to_json()
```


## Results
